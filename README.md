# Passionate Pursuit in Cozmo

To setup Cozmo's python SDK, follow the steps here (assuming you're in linux): http://cozmosdk.anki.com/docs/install-linux.html#install-linux. If you have an iPhone, it will tell you to install usbmuxd and redirect you to usbmuxd's github repo. You can just use "sudo apt-get install usbmuxd" instead, which is a little simpler.
